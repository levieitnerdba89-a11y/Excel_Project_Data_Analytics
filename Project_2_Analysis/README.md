- **Excel Features Used:** Utilized Excels pivot table feature to organize data and quickly express it in quantified fields by first preparing the data and then inserting the selected data fields into the appropriate pivot table areas (columns, rows, values) to create an accurate expresion of the desired data.
- **Design Choice:** I used a scatter chart because it expresses key data points, labels, and trend line while keeping the chart clear and easy to read.
- **Data Representation:** The correlations between the number of skills requested per role and the amount of compensation for each role.
- **Visual Enhancement:** Simple and effective white chart with blue data points and grey text. Keeping the chart clear for unobtrusive data interpretation.
- **Insights Gained:** Surprisingly to me, more data skills does not always correlate to higher compensation. It can, but there is a dinstinction that depends on which data science field is pursued. Data Engineer demands the most skills but does not command the highest salary. While Data Scientist demand significantly less skills compared to a Data Engineer but commands a significant margin increase in compensation.

- **Conclusion:** The data suggests that the career path one pursues has a greater effect on compensation than sheer number of data skills alone.

## 🔌: Power Query - A query tool with serious power

- **Excel Features Used:** Utilizing the dataset from my course, I loaded data into Power Query through "Get & Tranform Data"
- **Actions Taken:** I created a few custom columns for more accurate data expression. As well as cleaned column data, identified duplicates, and added a specific ID column for easier data-row reference while making an effort to maintain cleanliness of the "applied steps" area for greater ease when sharing and working on datasets with fellow collaborators.
  
- **Conclusion:** Functionality of Power Query is off the charts. It is amazingly powerful for organizing, cleaning, collaborating, and quantifying data to be pushed forwards for selective analysis.

## 🧩 Power Pivot

- **Function:** Data modeling by loading selected data into the power pivot model giving fast access and selectivity of large datasets.
- **Utilization:**
